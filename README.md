# Reinforcement Learning Projects  

This repository contains multiple Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects, each focusing on different environments, techniques, and learning strategies. The goal is to experiment with RL concepts, build structured implementations, and enhance my understanding of agent training, reward optimization, and decision-making in dynamic environments.  

Many of the implementations are inspired by concepts from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (Second Edition, MIT Press, 2018).

## Getting Started  

To explore any of the RL projects:  

1. Clone the repository:  
     git clone https://github.com/AraratDavtyan/Reinforcement-Learning.git
   cd Reinforcement-Learning
   2. Navigate to a specific project folder:  
     cd project-1
   3. Install dependencies (each project has its own `requirements.txt`):  
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   4. Run the project:  
     python main.py  # Or train.py depending on the project
